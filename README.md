# Doci-Doci-Crawling-Club
Doci-Doci-Crawling-Club is a tool that allows you to automate the development of your tool or sites documentation.
While you develop your project the bot crawls your files and looks for functions, commentsm stylings, id's etc that can be used in your documentation, this happens on your device so no privacy is breached.

# Used Libraries
* https://github.com/lukeplays33/Stereo

# How it works
The bots simply crawls through your code and then builds a documentation out of it, after the bot is done building you can manually edit the docs to your likings by either editing the HTMl manually, using Stereo to edit the site or any other 3rd party designing tool .
The site will then be available for you to download and publish.
